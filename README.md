# Field2farm-UI-UX
This UI/UX design project for the "Field to Farmer" app was created using Figma to streamline collaboration, prototyping, and handoff for development. The design focuses on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface that connects local farmers directly with consumers, promoting transparency, sustainability, and efficiency in the agricultural supply chain. The Figma file includes well-structured frames for key app screens such as onboarding, product listings, farmer profiles, cart/checkout, and user settings. Components, styles, and auto-layouts have been used to maintain consistency across the interface and support responsive behavior. Prototypes are included to demonstrate user flows and interactions. All assets are organized in layers and pages, with naming conventions and documentation to assist developers. This design system also includes reusable elements such as buttons, icons, and color/text styles. Please ensure access to the shared Figma file is granted before attempting to view or edit the project.
